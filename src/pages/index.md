## #about early bird <3

hello, you are here a bit early.
feel free to poke around,
but as long as this notice is here,
most documentation on this page will not be accurate (yet).

# webboot?

@webboot aims to make
[tofu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_on_first_use)
(trust on first use) a bit less scary.

we (and you?) run a network of validator nodes,
providing a source of integrity to homepages and webapps.

## #publisher publishers / developers.


* ### cli *- coming soon*

  the cli guides you through the process of signing and publishing your web properties.

* ### gui *- sometime in the future*

  the gui will provide a graphical userinterface, making it even easier to use webboot.

* ### app widgets *- coming soon*

  the webboot app widgets allow you to embed the webboot gui into your page.

  this allows you to show the webboot gui to every one of your users,
  even those that did not yet install any of the browser extensions.

* ### framework integrations - user *- coming soon*

  integration with react and vue to show a webboot gui

* ### build systems *- coming soon*

  plugins for webpack / babel / parcel.

## validators

validators are nodes in the webboot network.

@webboot is undergoing testing and once we are confident about the deployment story,
we will decentralize the network, allowing anyone to run a node.
